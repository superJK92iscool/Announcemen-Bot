**Announcement Bot Core**
This is a Discord Announcement bot, that was originally made my Starman/CamK that I modified to my liking.
*Requriements*
```
Visual Studio 2021 or JetBrains Rider
.Net 10.0
Discord.Net
```
It also has a command for geting status of a mc server, you can change the ports if needed, and if you don't need that feature, you can remove the `MCStatus.cs` file
On Discord Developer Portal, create a discord bot and copy the bot token, and open appsetting.Template.json and replace `"TOKEN"` with th bot token in Program.cs with that, there a several tutorials on how to make a discord bot, also make a role called `Announcements`, that way it will ping people with that role
